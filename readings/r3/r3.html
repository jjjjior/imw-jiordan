        <h1>WEBSITES AS OUTFITS</h1>
        <img class="beanie" src="beanie.png" alt="">
        <p>Outfits are our most evident forms of expression. We see what we like, buy what we like, and wear what we like. Whether it is in the form of plain colours, outlandish clothing pieces, or personal references, the pieces of clothing that build outfits are forms of personal expression.</p>
        <img class="shirt" src="shirt.png" alt="">
        <p>Outfits are seen by everyone and encapsulate you as a person. Outfits have basic needs such as a top piece and a bottom piece. While there are a variety many can choose from, we can agree those are essential. Then you can add on accessories, footwear, headwear, and layering pieces to finalize what you want everyone to see when you go out.</p>
        <img class="pants"  src="pants.png" alt="">
        <p>It is the ultimate form of self-expression that gives you full power to pick and choose how you want to be seen and explored by others.</p>
